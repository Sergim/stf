# stf

The goal of stf is to obtain and manipulate data from the Brazilian Supreme Court decisions. The package makes an effort to clean and tidy the data so you might get it almost ready for your analysis.

## Installation

You can install the released version of stf from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("stf")
```

## Usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
